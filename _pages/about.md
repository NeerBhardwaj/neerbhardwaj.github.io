I am a mathematics doctoral candidate at UIUC. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        
Before coming over to Illinois, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kanpur" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.

### Research

I work broadly with the interactions of model theory with algebra and number theory. More precisely, my recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.
