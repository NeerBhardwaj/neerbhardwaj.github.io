I now work as a data scientist, and I will keep these pages as a log of my professional activities as a mathematician. 

I received my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; my advisor was <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries/" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. Then I held postdoc positions with <a href="https://binyamini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Gal Binyamini</a> at the Weizmann Institute of Science, and with <a href="https://rcluckers.perso.math.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Raf Cluckers</a> at KU Leuven.

### Research interests

I am interested in the interactions of tame analytic geometry with algebra, model theory, and number theory.

<!-- ### Interests

I am interested in o-minimality and the model theory of valued fields, and 

More precisely, I work on developing counting strategies using ideas from arithmetic, complex analysis, o-minimality, and model theory of valued fields, and pursuing ensuing applications.-->

<!-- my work revolves around the variations and analogues of the Pila-Wilkie Counting Theorem, both in the Archimedean and non-Archimedean contexts, and pursing the subse applications from such results.

 My work involves ideas from arithmetic, algebra, complex analysis, geometry, o-minimality, and the model theory of valued fields.-->

More precisely, recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.-->
