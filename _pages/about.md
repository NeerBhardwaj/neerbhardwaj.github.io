I am a mathematics doctoral candidate at UIUC. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        
Before coming over to Illinois, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kanpur" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.
<!--I was an NSF sponsored intern at the Argonne National Lab for summer 2020. -->

I am on the job market, seeking positions starting in the latter half of 2022, and happy to share my CV and research statement upon request.

My recent work is with the algebra and model theory of valued fields, and o-minimality and its applications. 

## Papers

Ax-Kochen-Ersov theory for restricted analytic functions, including the induced structure on residue field and value group,
: in preparation.


On the Pila-Wilkie theorem, [<a href="http://neerbhardwaj.github.io/files/On%20the%20Pila-Wilkie%20theorem.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14046" target=_blank>arXiv</a>]
: with Lou van den Dries, <i>Expositiones Mathematicae</i>, accepted, pending minor revisions.
> This expository paper gives an account of the Pila-Wilkie counting theorem and some of its extensions and generalizations. We use semialgebraic cell decomposition to simplify part of the original proof. Included are complete treatments of a result due to Pila and Bombieri and of the o-minimal Yomdin-Gromov theorem that are used in this proof. 

The additive groups of $ℤ$ and $ℚ$ with predicates for being square-free, [<a href="http://neerbhardwaj.github.io/files/The%20additive%20groups%20of%20ℤ%20and%20%20ℚ%20with%20predicates%20for%20being%20square-free.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00096" target="_blank">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jsl.2020.30" target="_blank">DOI</a>]
: with Minh Chieu Tran, <i>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</i>, to appear.
: View one of our structures in the <a href="http://forkinganddividing.com/#_02_54" target="blank">model theory universe</a>.
> We consider the four structures $(ℤ;\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ)$, $(ℤ;<,\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ)$, $(ℚ;\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ)$, and $(ℚ;<,\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ)$ where $ℤ$ is the additive group of integers, $\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ$ is the set of $a\in ℤ$ such that $v_p(a)<2$ for every prime $p$ and corresponding $p$-adic valuation $v_p$, $ℚ$ and $\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ$ are defined likewise for rational numbers, and $<$ denotes the natural ordering on each of these domains. We prove that the second structure is model-theoretically wild while the other three structures are model-theoretically tame. Moreover, all these results can be seen as examples where number-theoretic randomness yields model-theoretic consequences.
