I am a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I work with <a href="https://binyamini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Gal Binyamini</a>.

I got my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Advisor: <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        


### Research

My work involves an interplay of ideas from algebra, model theory and number theory.

More precisely, I am interested in developing counting strategies using ideas from arithmetic, complex analysis, o-minimality, model theory of valued fields; and pursuing ensuing applications.

<!--  my work revolves around the variations and analogues of the Pila-Wilkie Counting Theorem, both in the Archimedean and non-Archimedean contexts, and pursing the subse applications from such results.

 My work involves ideas from arithmetic, algebra, complex analysis, geometry, o-minimality, and the model theory of valued fields.-->

<!-- I am interested in the interactions of model theory with algebra and number theory. 

More precisely, recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.-->
