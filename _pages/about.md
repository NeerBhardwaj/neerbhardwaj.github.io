I am a mathematics doctoral candidate at UIUC. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        
Before coming over to Illinois, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kanpur" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.
<!--I was an NSF sponsored intern at the Argonne National Lab for summer 2020. -->
