I am a postdoc at KU Leuven, where my host is <a href="https://rcluckers.perso.math.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank">Raf Cluckers</a>.
<br> 

Previously, I was a postdoc with <a href="https://binyamini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Gal Binyamini</a> at the Weizmann Institute of Science. <br/>
I received my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where my advisor was <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries/" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 

### Research interests

My work involves an interplay of ideas from algebra, analytic geometry, model theory, and number theory.

<!-- ### Interests

I am interested in o-minimality and the model theory of valued fields, and 

More precisely, I work on developing counting strategies using ideas from arithmetic, complex analysis, o-minimality, and model theory of valued fields, and pursuing ensuing applications.-->

<!-- my work revolves around the variations and analogues of the Pila-Wilkie Counting Theorem, both in the Archimedean and non-Archimedean contexts, and pursing the subse applications from such results.

 My work involves ideas from arithmetic, algebra, complex analysis, geometry, o-minimality, and the model theory of valued fields.-->
<!-- I am interested in the interactions of model theory with algebra and number theory. 

More precisely, recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.-->
