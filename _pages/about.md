I am a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I work with Gal Binyamini.<br /> 
I earned my PhD at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with Lou van den Dries. 
        
My work involves an interplay of ideas from algebra, model theory, and number theory.

<!-- ### Interests

More precisely, I work on developing counting strategies using ideas from arithmetic, complex analysis, o-minimality, and model theory of valued fields, and pursuing ensuing applications.-->

<!-- my work revolves around the variations and analogues of the Pila-Wilkie Counting Theorem, both in the Archimedean and non-Archimedean contexts, and pursing the subse applications from such results.

 My work involves ideas from arithmetic, algebra, complex analysis, geometry, o-minimality, and the model theory of valued fields.-->
<!-- I am interested in the interactions of model theory with algebra and number theory. 

More precisely, recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.-->
