I am a mathematics doctoral candidate at UIUC. My research interests lie primarily in model theory and its applications. I am part of the <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/research/faculty-research/logic" target="_blank">Logic</a> group, and my advisor is <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        
Before coming over to Illinois, I received my undergraduate education at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kanpur" target="_blank"> IIT Kanpur</a>.<br>
<!--I was an NSF sponsored intern at the Argonne National Lab for summer 2020. -->
I'm on the job market right now, looking for psoitions starting in the latter part of 2022.

My recent work is with the model theory of valued fields, and o-minimality and its applications. 

## Papers

Ax-Kochen-Ersov theory for restricted analytic functions, including the induced structure on residue field and value group. 
: [In Preparation]


On the Pila-Wilkie theorem. [<a href="http://neerbhardwaj.github.io/files/On%20the%20Pila-Wilkie%20theorem.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14046" target=_blank>arXiv</a>]
: with Lou van den Dries, <i>Accepted, pending minor revisions</i>.
: <br>
: <i> This expository paper gives an account of the Pila-Wilkie counting theorem and some of its extensions and generalizations. We use semialgebraic cell decomposition to simplify part of the original proof. Included are complete treatments of a result due to Pila and Bombieri and of the o-minimal Yomdin-Gromov theorem that are used in this proof. </i> 

The additive groups of $ℤ$ and $ℚ$ with predicates for being square-free. [<a href="http://neerbhardwaj.github.io/files/The%20additive%20groups%20of%20ℤ%20and%20%20ℚ%20with%20predicates%20for%20being%20square-free.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00096" target="_blank">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jsl.2020.30" target="_blank">DOI</a>]
: with Minh Chieu Tran, <i>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</i>, vol. 85 (2020).
: <br>
: <i>We consider the four structures $(ℤ;\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ)$, $(ℤ;<,\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ)$, $(ℚ;\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ)$, and $(ℚ;<,\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ)$ where $ℤ$ is the additive group of integers, $\mbox{Sqf}^ℤ$ is the set of $a\in ℤ$ such that $v_p(a)<2$ for every prime $p$ and corresponding $p$-adic valuation $v_p$, $ℚ$ and $\mbox{Sqf}^ℚ$ are defined likewise for rational numbers, and $<$ denotes the natural ordering on each of these domains. We prove that the second structure is model-theoretically wild while the other three structures are model-theoretically tame. Moreover, all these results can be seen as examples where number-theoretic randomness yields model-theoretic consequences.</i>
