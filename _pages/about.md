I am a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I work with <a href="https://binyamini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Gal Binyamini</a>.

I got my PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Advisor: <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/vddries" target="_blank">Lou van den Dries</a>. 
        


### Research

I am interested in the interactions of model theory with algebra and number theory. 

More precisely, recent work has been with o-minimality and its applications, and the algebra and model theory of valued fields.
